Check Nagios Config
-------------------

Check for existence or non-existence of a file or files - using glob patterns.

*INSTALL*

Example:

----
wget https://raw.github.com/mclarkson/check_file_exists_glob/master/check_file_exists_glob
chmod +x check_file_exists_glob
mv check_file_exists_glob /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/
----

*EXAMPLE OUTPUT*

----
OK: File 'asdfg*' is absent, good.

OK: File 'asdf*' is present, good. | "asdf*"=3

WARNING:  File 'asdfg*' found in '/home/clarkm93/bob/'. | "asdfg*"=2

CRITICAL:  File 'asdf*' found in '/home/clarkm93/bob/'. | "asdf*"=3

----

*MANUAL PAGE*

----
$ ./check_file_exists_glob -h

check_file_exists_glob - Alert if a FILE does not exist.

Usage: check_file_exists_glob [options] -d DIR FILE

 FILE    :  The file to search for. Can glob using '*' etc, but
            place file names with glob patterns within quotes.
            Mandatory. The FILE must always be specified.
 -d DIR  :  Base directory to search in.
            Mandatory option - the DIR must always be specified.
 -i      :  Invert FILE, so alert if FILE does exist.
 -I      :  Alert if DIR does not exist.
 -p      :  Add performance data output for graphing.
 -w NUM  :  Warning alert if >=NUM files are found and invert
            files '-i' is on. (Default is: 1)
 -c NUM  :  Critical alert if >=NUM files are found and invert
            files '-i' is on. (Default is: 1)
 -o      :  Output the content of the file if found
 -h      :  Display this help text.

Example:

  Check that /tmp/dir/file exists.

    ./check_file_exists_glob -d /tmp/dir file

  Check that /tmp/dir/file does NOT exist.

    ./check_file_exists_glob -d /tmp/dir -i file

  Again check that /tmp/dir/file does NOT exist but this time alert
  if the directory it could be found in, /tmp/dir, is missing.

    ./check_file_exists_glob -d /tmp -i -I file

  Check for files matching the glob 'fi*' and alert if found in
  /tmp/dir. Alert if /tmp/dir does not exist. Provide performance
  data for graphing, showing the number of files matching the
  glob pattern.

    ./check_file_exists_glob -d /tmp/dir -i -I -p "fi*"

  Same as previous but only alert if thresholds are exceeded. In
  this case issue a warning alert when there are 20 or more files
  found, critical for 30 or more.

    ./check_file_exists_glob -d /tmp/dir -i -I -p -w 20 -c 30 "fi*"
